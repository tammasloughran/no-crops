	abstract = {Forestation is a major component of future long-term emissions reduction and CO2 removal strategies, but the viability of carbon stored in vegetation under future climates is highly uncertain. We analyze the results from seven CMIP6 models for a combined scenario with high fossil fuel emissions (from SSP58.5) and forest expansion (from SSP1-2.6) which has ∼4.8\% increase in global total forest cover relative to 2015. This scenario aims to demonstrate the ability of forestation strategies to mitigate climate change under continued increasing CO2 emissions and includes the potential impacts of increased CO2 concentration and a warming climate on vegetation growth. The model intercomparison shows that forestation as a CO2 removal strategy has limited impact on global climate under a high global warming scenario, despite generating a substantial cumulative carbon sink of 10–60 Pg C over the period 2015–2100. Using a single model ensemble, we show that there are local increases in warm extremes in response to forestation associated with decreases in the number of cool days. Furthermore, we find evidence of a shift in the global carbon balance, whereby increased carbon storage on land of ∼25 Pg C by 2100 associated with forestation has a concomitant decrease  in the carbon uptake by the ocean due to reduced atmospheric CO2 concentrations.},

	abstract = {Forestation is widely proposed for carbon dioxide (CO2) removal, but its impact on climate through changes to atmospheric composition and surface albedo remains relatively unexplored. We assessed these respnses using two Earth system models by comparing a scenario with extensive global forest expansion in suitable regions to other plausible futures. We found that forestation increased aerosol scattering and the greenhouse gases methane and ozone following increased biogenic organic emissions. Additionally, forestation decreased surface albedo, which yielded a positive radiative forcing (i.e., warming). This offset up to a third of the negative forcing from the additional CO2 removal under a 4°C warming scenario. However, when forestation was pursued alongside other strategies that achieve the 2°C Paris Agreement target, the offsetting positive forcing was smaller, highlighting the urgency for simultaneous emission reductions., Editor’s summary Forestation is considered a good way to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide and cool climate, but its impact on climate is more complex than just its effects through carbon capture. Weber et al. explored the impacts of forestation on climate by quantifying its influence on surface albedo and atmospheric composition (see the Perspective by Hayman). They found that the combination of decreased reflection and increased aerosol scattering of incident sunlight offsets about one-third of the cooling by carbon dioxide removal that forestation produces. —H.
